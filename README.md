# EulerBernoulliBeam

The notebook presents a simple investigation into the behavior of an Euler-Bernoulli beam analyzed with a finite difference method. After implementation of the beam, an investigation is done into the deflection behavior for different applications of the same total load. 

Python version 3.7.
